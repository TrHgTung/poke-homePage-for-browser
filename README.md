A colorful HTML/CSS design for you can set the home page (start page) of your browser (Firefox/Chromium browsers work well)


Hello,

Download and save this project on a local directory that you remember, then open your browser, go to Settings of the browser, find and change the Open and Startup/New Tab feature:

- Microsoft Edge (newer ver. - Windows 11): Settings >>> Start, home and new tabs >>> Home button >>> Open file, and choose the file "greeting.html", then Save

- Google Chrome: like Edge

- Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-set-the-home-page

Thanks.

        Damn, you know? I've tried to search how to get System Username to replace "admin" in the code,
        but I cannot, so just keep it =))) Or you can open this file (greeting.html) with a Text Editor (like Notepad/ VS Code/ Sublime Text/..) to edit and change the variable admin (line 79) to the string name you want
