# poke-homePage-for-browser

A colorful HTML/CSS design for you can set the home page (start page) of your browser (Firefox/Chromium browsers work well)

Details:

- A colorful HTML file, with HTML/CSS and JS basically
- For people who like Pokemon, and the cuteness, would like to replace the bored default <ins>New Tab</ins> on browser
- JS (JavaScript) give you a greeting based on the system time. Ex: time: 23:20 >> "Good Night, Admin!"
- Short animations
- Comparative with Chromnium and Firefox browser, or others but I've not tested.

Hello,

Download and save this project on a local directory that you remember, then open your browser, go to Settings of the browser, find and change the Open and Startup/New Tab feature:

- Microsoft Edge (newer ver. - Windows 11): Settings >>> Start, home and new tabs >>> Home button >>> Open file, and choose the file "greeting.html", then Save

- Google Chrome: like Edge

- Firefox: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-to-set-the-home-page

Thanks.
